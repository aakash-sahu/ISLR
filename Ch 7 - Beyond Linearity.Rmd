This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


## Non -linear models

```{r}
library(ISLR)
attach(Wage)
View(Wage)
```

Polynomials

Response on age

```{r}
fit = lm(wage ~ poly(age, 4), data = Wage)
summary(fit)
```
Plotting the polynomial fit

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
agelims = range(age)
age.grid = seq(from = agelims[1], to = agelims[2])
preds = predict(fit, newdata = list(age = age.grid), se = TRUE)
#preds
se.bands = cbind(preds$fit + 2*preds$se, preds$fit - 2*preds$se)
plot(age, wage, col = "darkgrey")
lines(age.grid, preds$fit, lwd = 2, col = 'blue')
matlines(age.grid, se.bands, col = 'blue', lty =2)

```

LM without the poly function

```{r}
fita = lm(wage ~ age + I(age^2) + I(age^3) + I(age^4), data = Wage)
summary(fita)
```

The p-values changes as polynomial function changed

```{r}
plot(fitted(fit), fitted(fita))
```

This only works with linear regression and if there is  a single predictor. To compare two models, we would need anova

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
fita=lm(wage~education,data=Wage)
fitb=lm(wage~education+age,data=Wage)
fitc=lm(wage~education+poly(age,2),data=Wage)
fitd=lm(wage~education+poly(age,3),data=Wage)
anova(fita,fitb,fitc,fitd)
```

#Polynomial Logistic regression

```{r}
fit = glm(I(wage > 250) ~ poly(age, 3), data = Wage, family = binomial)
summary(fit)
preds = predict(fit, newdata = list(age = age.grid), se = TRUE)
se.bands = preds$fit + cbind(fit =0, lower = - 2*preds$se, upper = 2*preds$se)
se.bands[1:5,]
```
We have done the computations on the logit scale. To transform we need to apply the inverse logit
mapping 
$$p=\frac{e^\eta}{1+e^\eta}.$$
(Here we have used the ability of MarkDown to interpret TeX expressions.) 
We can do this simultaneously for all three columns of `se.bands`:

```{r}
prob.bands = exp(se.bands)/(1 + exp(se.bands))
matplot(age.grid,prob.bands,col="blue",lwd=c(2,1,1),lty=c(1,2,2),type="l",ylim=c(0,.1))
points(jitter(age),I(wage>250)/10,pch="|",cex=.5)
```

Splines
-------
Splines are more flexible than polynomials, but the idea is rather similar.
Here we will explore cubic splines.
```{r}
library(splines)
fit = lm(wage ~ bs(age, knots = c(25,40,60)), data = Wage)
summary(fit)
plot(age, wage, col = "darkgrey")
lines(age.grid,predict(fit,list(age=age.grid)),col="darkgreen",lwd=2)
abline(v=c(25,40,60),lty=2,col="darkgreen")

#smoothing spline
fit = smooth.spline(age, wage, df = 16)
lines(fit, col = "red", lwd =2)

#LOOCV
fit = smooth.spline(age, wage, cv = TRUE)
lines(fit, col = 'purple', lwd = 2)
fit
```
The smoothing splines does not require knot selection, but it does have a smoothing parameter,
which can conveniently be specified via the effective degrees of freedom or `df`.

```{r}
fit = smooth.spline(age, wage, df = 16)
lines(fit, col = "red", lwd =2)
```
Using LOO cross-validation

```{r}
fit = smooth.spline(age, wage, cv = TRUE)
lines(fit, col = 'purple', lwd = 2)
fit
```


Generalized Additive Models
---------------------------

So far we have focused on fitting models with mostly single nonlinear terms.
The `gam` package makes it easier to work with multiple nonlinear terms. In addition 
it knows how to plot these functions and their standard errors.

```{r}
#install.packages("gam")
require(gam)

gam1 = gam(wage ~ s(age, df=4) + s(year, df =4) + education, data = Wage)
summary(gam1)
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(gam1,se=T)
gam2=gam(I(wage>250)~s(age,df=4)+s(year,df=4)+education,data=Wage,family=binomial)
gam2
plot(gam2)
```
Lets see if we need a nonlinear terms for year
```{r}
gam2a = gam(I(wage > 250) ~ s(age, df = 4) + year +education, data = Wage, family = binomial)
plot(gam2a)
anova(gam2a, gam2, test = "Chisq")
```

One nice feature of the `gam` package is that it knows how to plot the functions nicely,
even for models fit by `lm` and `glm`.

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
library(gam)
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
lm1=lm(wage~ns(age,df=4)+ns(year,df=4)+education,data=Wage)
plot.gam(lm1,se=T)
```
